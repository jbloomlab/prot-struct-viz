"""Regenerate the five coloring CSVs for the 8FAW antigenic-regions example.

The CSVs are committed, and this script is **not** run by
``scripts/build_examples.sh`` or by the tests -- ``spec.yaml`` reads the
committed files. Run this by hand when the inputs below change::

    .venv/bin/python examples/8faw_antigenic_regions/make_coloring_csv.py

It writes one CSV per view of ``spec.yaml``, each named after the view that
reads it -- so a name here that no view claims is a name that has gone stale:

* ``antigenic-regions-w-glycans.csv`` -- every residue, HA1 colored by antigenic
  region, plus the host N-glycans and the LSTc receptor analogue;
* ``antigenic-regions.csv`` -- the same without the host-glycan rows, so that the
  view's ``glycans: hide`` can take them away;
* ``perth-2009-to-subclade-k.csv`` and ``2025-26-to-2026-27-vaccine.csv`` -- the
  sites that differ between two HAs, in red, plus the same LSTc rows;
* ``subclade-k-with-region-d-mutations.csv`` -- the second of those two lists again,
  with HA1 222 and 223 added in a color of their own.

It exists because the ~490 rows of the first two are derived from two external
sources, and a table that large is only auditable if its derivation ships with
it. Two things it fetches rather than hard-codes:

* the lab's H3N2 site-numbering map, which is what turns a residue number into
  an HA1 or HA2 site number;
* PDB 8FAW itself, so that only *modeled* residues get a row.

The two mutation lists are the exception: they are hard-coded below rather than
recomputed from the sequence libraries they came from, so that this repository
depends on nothing outside itself. What the script still owns for them is the
mapping from an HA1/HA2 site to a residue of 8FAW, and the check that every one
of them is actually modeled.

The numbering frame is the load-bearing assumption throughout, so it is asserted
rather than trusted: if a revised map or a different entry ever shifts it, this
script fails instead of writing a plausible-looking but wrong CSV.
